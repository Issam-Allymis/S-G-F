The [Strong Gym Fitness](https://issam-allymis.github.io/S-G-F/index.html) Page is a web page that provides information about the gym's membership plans and pricing. The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear calls-to-action that encourage users to sign up for a membership.

The Strong Gym Fitness Page is built entirely using HTML and CSS, without the need for any additional programming languages or frameworks. The page includes information about each membership plan, such as the price, the duration, and the benefits of each plan.

The page also includes a membership sign-up form that users can fill out to become members of the gym. The form includes fields for personal information, such as name and email address, as well as options to select a membership plan and payment method.

The Strong Gym Fitness Page is designed to be responsive, meaning that it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users can view and sign up for memberships on any device, whether they're using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

# Design
## Typography
Google Fonts was used for:
- Quicksand is used for the heading of the site.
- Oswald is used for the body text of the site.

## Colour Scheme
- [Color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1023831)
![color palette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126810074/227796932-ad18b931-f7ea-44c2-a2ce-2ae51ad371dc.png)

**I chose these colours because:**
- Blue is often associated with trust, reliability, and professionalism, which could be desirable qualities for a gym to convey to its customers.
- Blue is also a calming colour that can evoke a sense of tranquility and relaxation. This could be appealing to gym-goers who want to feel at ease while working out.
- The combination of blue shades with the darker gray and black tones creates a pleasing contrast that can make the design more visually interesting.
 
# Wireframes
As part of the planning stage, I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes. This helped me to get a general idea of how I wanted to design the website. Some of the initial ideas I had for the website may have changed during the development process. The shift in ideas came from external feedback and personal reflection.

 - To increase the content on the homepage, additional features have been added to the layout, enhancing its overall design. On the homepage you can find information regarding the timetable, nutritional foods along with their benefits and reasons to workout.

 - I chose to use the masonry layout for the gallery page on my website as I felt it was the best fit at the time. Additionally, I added an embedded YouTube video, which was not included in the original gallery wireframe design.

 - The sign-up page layout closely resembles the wireframe, with a few additional features such as a motivational speech and a dropdown list showcasing all the gym membership deals available at Strong Gym, providing customers with a better understanding of what the gym has to offer.

# Feautures
## Page Elements
### Navigation Bar
![Screenshot 2023-03-27 151826](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126810074/228066146-b310d2d4-37e7-4f6b-a1b4-de46422d963f.png)

- The navigation bar is located at the top of the page wrapped inside the header element. My menu is designed to make it simple for users to easily navigate through    pages. I added a hover effect to the menu to make the user experience more visually appealing and clean. I have designed the menu to highlight the current page a user is on, providing a clear indication of the user's location and reducing confusion for a better user experience. 

### Timetable

- Our timetable displays all the training classes available to gym members from morning until early afternoon. Our gym offers classes from Monday to Friday. On weekends, we encourage gym-goers to attend a coffee meetup with fellow members and personal trainers to connect and get to know each other better over a cup of coffee.

### Personal Trainers
- Each class is led by a professional trainer who provides helpful training tips to attendees. Each trainer ensures that attendees perform each exercise with correct form and maximum effort. Correct form is essential to reduce the risk of injury and achieve faster, more effective results.

- The footer, which uses the same [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons throughout, is located at the bottom of every page to maintain visual consistency. Each icon are linked to their corresponding social media websites for customers who want to know more about the gym and recieve the latest updates.

- The contact form lets user input their personal information which includes their first and last name, their email address and indicate whether they want to join the gym to train with a group or solo when signing up. The web page also includes a motivational message to encourage our customers or potential customers to take action and sign up, so they can start pursuing their dreams and achieve their body goals.

# Resolved Bugs

- The margin-left for the meet up section was larger than the screen width, which in turn caused the page to scroll horizontally to compensate the margin overflow. I tackled the issue by reducing the margin-left.

 ![Screenshot 2023-03-19 123654](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126810074/228842289-6f24a043-ec25-4ac5-b34d-7a6e603a022c.png)

- at 800px down, the Timetable section had large rows of six that separated the heading and the timetable which in turn didnt look visually pleasing. Initially these rows were columns that contained the 5 days of the week from Monday to Friday and the text "Times" which had the class times displayed below. I combatted this issue by reducing the height of the table heading as to bring the heading and timetable closer to eachother to reduce empty spaces on the page. It was my best solution at the time of completion.

## Forking The GitHub Repository
Forks are commonly used in the GitHub platform, allowing users to create a duplicate of an existing repository on their own account. This duplication allows users to view and make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. Forking can be used for various purposes, such as to contribute to a project, experiment with changes without affecting the original codebase, or create a new project based on an existing one. 
 
## **How to Fork a GitHub Repository**
1. Log into your GitHub account and locate the project at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis?tab=repositories)
2. Locate the Fork button at the top right of the page and click Fork.
