# Strong Gym Fitness

The [Strong Gym Fitness](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/S-G-F) Page is a web page that provides information about the gym's membership plans and pricing. The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear calls-to-action that encourage users to sign up for a membership.

The Strong Gym Fitness Page is built entirely using HTML and CSS, without the need for any additional programming languages or frameworks. The page includes information about each membership plan, such as the price, the duration, and the benefits of each plan.

The page also includes a membership sign-up form that users can fill out to become members of the gym. The form includes fields for personal information, such as name and email address, as well as options to select a membership plan and payment method.

The Strong Gym Fitness Page is designed to be responsive, meaning that it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users can view and sign up for memberships on any device, whether they're using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

# Design
## Typography
Google Fonts was used for:

## Colour Scheme
- [Color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1023831)

**I chose these colours because**
- Blue is often associated with trust, reliability, and professionalism, which could be desirable qualities for a gym to convey to its customers.
- Blue is also a calming colour that can evoke a sense of tranquility and relaxation. This could be appealing to gym-goers who want to feel at ease while working out.
- The combination of blue shades with the darker gray and black tones creates a pleasing contrast that can make the design more visually interesting.

## Page Elements
### Navigation Bar
(image)
The navigation bar is located at the top of the page wrapped inside the header element. My menu is designed to make it simple for users to easily navigate through    pages. I added a hover effect to the menu to make the user experience more visually appealing and clean. I have designed the menu to highlight the current page a user is on, providing a clear indication of the user's location and reducing confusion for a better user experience. 

### Timetable

Our timetable displays all the training classes available to gym members from morning until early afternoon. Our gym offers classes from Monday to Friday. On weekends, we encourage gym-goers to attend a coffee meetup with fellow members and personal trainers to connect and get to know each other better over a cup of coffee.

### Personal Trainers
Each class is led by a professional trainer who provides helpful training tips to attendees. Each trainer ensures that attendees perform each exercise with correct form and maximum effort. Correct form is essential to reduce the risk of injury and achieve faster, more effective results.
