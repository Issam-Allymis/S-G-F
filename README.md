# Strong Gym Fitness

The [Strong Gym Fitness](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/S-G-F) Page is a web page that provides information about the gym's membership plans and pricing. The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear calls-to-action that encourage users to sign up for a membership.

The Strong Gym Fitness Page is built entirely using HTML and CSS, without the need for any additional programming languages or frameworks. The page includes information about each membership plan, such as the price, the duration, and the benefits of each plan.

The page also includes a membership sign-up form that users can fill out to become members of the gym. The form includes fields for personal information, such as name and email address, as well as options to select a membership plan and payment method.

The Strong Gym Fitness Page is designed to be responsive, meaning that it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users can view and sign up for memberships on any device, whether they're using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.


# Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
