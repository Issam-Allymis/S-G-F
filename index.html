      <h2> Health Benefits</h2>
      <h3>Why Should You Take Care Of Your Physical Health</h3>
      <ul>

      <div id="services" id="about">
      <li>
      <h3>Reduces Stress and Anxiety</h3> 
       <p> 
        Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, 
        which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators. 
        Exercise also reduces the levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can contribute to feelings of anxiety and tension.
       </p>
      </li>
    


   
      <li>
      <h3>Boosts Mood</h3> 
       <p>Regular exercise can also boost mood by increasing the production of serotonin and dopamine, which are neurotransmitters that regulate mood and happiness. 
      Exercise has also been shown to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.
       </p>
      </li>
   

  
   
      <li>
      <h3>Heart Health</h3> 
      <p>Exercise is one of the best things you can do to improve your heart health. Regular exercise can lower blood pressure, reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, 
      and increase HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Exercise can also improve blood flow to the heart, reduce the risk of blood clots, and improve overall cardiovascular function.
      </p>
      </li>
    

    
      <li><h3>Cognitive Function</h3> 
      <p>Exercise has been shown to enhance cognitive function, including memory, attention, and learning. 
      Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which can improve brain function and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. 
      Exercise has also been shown to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
