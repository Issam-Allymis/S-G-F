         <h3>Salmon:</h3>
         <p>
           Salmon is a great source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D. Protein is important for muscle repair and growth, 
           while omega-3 fatty acids are known for reducing inflammation in the body. Vitamin D is essential for bone health and also 
           plays a role in muscle function. Additionally, salmon is a low-fat source of protein, making it a great option for those 
           looking to maintain or lose weight.

         <h3>Sweet potatoes:</h3>
           <p>
             Sweet potatoes are a nutrient-dense carbohydrate source that can provide sustained energy for workouts. They're also rich in vitamins 
             and minerals such as vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, and iron. These nutrients are important for maintaining a healthy immune system, 
             promoting healthy skin and eyesight, and aiding in muscle function.

         <h3>Greek yogurt:</h3>
           <p>
             Greek yogurt is a high-protein, low-fat dairy option that's great for gym-goers. It's packed with essential amino acids, which are necessary 
             for muscle growth and repair. Greek yogurt is also a good source of calcium, which is important for bone health. Additionally, the probiotics 
             found in Greek yogurt can aid in digestion and support a healthy gut microbiome.
